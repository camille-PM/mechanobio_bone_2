# mechanobio_bone_2

Mechanobiological model for bone regeneration in a large bone defect left empty (main branch) and complemented with a PCL-TCP scaffold (branch scaffold_presence).

Implementing surface-guided cell migration and ECM deposition and biological activity reduction (empty defect) or stimulation by ceramic TCP (defect with scaffold).
